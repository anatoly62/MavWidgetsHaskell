MavWidget is a virtual facade library. It incapulates the differences
between the actual libraries for Desktop applications (Gtk, lup, Sciter)
used. There are also MavWidgets for PureScript to be used in browser
applications; minimal code modifications are required to compensate
PureScript and Haskell incompatibility.
